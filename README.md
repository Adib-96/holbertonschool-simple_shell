# :iphone: Simple-_shell:

This is a basic implementation of a command-line shell in C, designed to provide users with a minimalistic yet functional interface for interacting with their operating system. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals of shell programming or an enthusiast who wants to tinker with a simple shell, this project is a great starting point.


## :sparkles: Features

Command execution: Run system commands just like you would in a regular terminal.
Basic built-in commands: The shell supports a few built-in commands such as cd (change directory) and exit (exit the shell).
Input and output redirection: Redirect the standard input and output of commands using < and > operators.
Pipeline support: Chain multiple commands together using the | operator for input-output redirection.

Compilation : `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`
