## :Fountain: Features

Command execution: Run system commands just like you would in a regular terminal.
Basic built-in commands: The shell supports a few built-in commands such as cd (change directory) and exit (exit the shell).
Input and output redirection: Redirect the standard input and output of commands using < and > operators.
Pipeline support: Chain multiple commands together using the | operator for input-output redirection.
